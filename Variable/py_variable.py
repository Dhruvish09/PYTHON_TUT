# Variable Createtion Rules:-
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Valid Variable Syntaxt:-
# myvar = "Dhruv"
# my_var = "Dhruv"
# _my_var = "Dhruv"
# myVar = "Dhruv"
# MYVAR = "Dhruv"
# myvar2 = "Dhruv"


# Multi Words Variable Names:-
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There Are 3 type of Variable:-

print("(1)Camel Case")
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "Dhruv"
print(myVariableName)

print("(2)Pascal Case")
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "Dhruv"
print(MyVariableName)

print("(3)Snake Case")
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "Dhruv"
print(my_variable_name,end="\n\n")


# Normal Vairable
print("1 Program Output:")
a=12
b="Dhruvish"
c=12.5
d=12j

print(a,b,c,d,end="\n\n")

# Casting Variable
print("2 Program Output:")
a=int(12.5)
b=str("Dhruvish")
c=float(12)
print(a,b,c,end="\n\n")

# Variable Type
print("3 Program Output:")
a=12
b="Dhruvish"
c=9.0
print(type(a),type(b),type(c),end="\n\n")
