(1)What is aws lambda?
Ans:  AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you can upload your code and AWS takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extracting the HTTP method and request body from the event
    http_method = event['httpMethod']
    request_body = event['body']

    # Responding differently based on the HTTP method
    if http_method == 'GET':
        response_body = "This is a GET request."
    elif http_method == 'POST':
        # Assuming request body is JSON
        request_data = json.loads(request_body)
        response_body = f"This is a POST request. Received data: {request_data}"
    else:
        response_body = f"Unsupported HTTP method: {http_method}"

    # Returning the response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(response_body)
    }
