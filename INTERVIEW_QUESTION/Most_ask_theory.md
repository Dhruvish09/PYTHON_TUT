# ✅ PYTHON INTERVIEW Q&A (THEORY)

## 🔹 1. Difference Between List and Dictionary
**List**: Ordered collection of items, indexed by integers. 
**Dictionary**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

---

## 🔹 2. Difference Between `append()` and `extend()`
- `append()`: Adds a single element to the end of a list.
- `extend()`: Adds elements from another iterable to the end of the list.

---

## 🔹 3. Can We Use List/Tuple as Dict Key?
Only **immutable types** can be used as dictionary keys. 
- ✅ Tuples can be keys (if they don’t contain mutable elements like lists).
- ❌ Lists can't be keys.

---

## 🔹 4. Why Python is Dynamically Typed? (Duck Typing)
- No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- Variables take type based on the assigned value at runtime.
- "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."

---

## 🔹 5. Why Python is an Interpreted Language?
- Executes line-by-line using an interpreter.
- No separate compilation step.
- Errors stop execution immediately and show messages.

---

## 🔹 6. What is Lambda Function?
- Anonymous function defined with `lambda` keyword.
- Syntax: `lambda arguments: expression`

---

## 🔹 7. Call by Value vs Call by Reference in Python
- Python uses **Call by Object Reference**.
- Mutable types (like list) reflect changes, immutable types don’t.

---

## 🔹 8. What is MRO (Method Resolution Order)?
- Used in **multiple inheritance** to determine method lookup order.
- Python uses **C3 Linearization**: Bottom to top, left to right.

---

## 🔹 9. What If We Don’t Use `with` Statement for Files?
**With statement handles:** 
- Automatic file closing via `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`.
- Without `with`, manual `close()` required.

---

## 🔹 10. What is OOPS in Python?
**Object-Oriented Programming System:**
- Concepts: Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
- **Constructor:** `__init__()` method auto-runs when object created.

---

## 🔹 11. Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication**: Verify identity (e.g., login)
- **Authorization**: Grant access (e.g., admin role)
- Tools: JWT, RBAC

---

## 🔹 12. How Django Migrations Work?
1. Modify `models.py`
2. `makemigrations`
3. Review generated files
4. `migrate` to apply
5. Track with `showmigrations`
6. DB Schema Updated

---

## 🔹 13. Django ORM Working
- `Product.objects.all()` → Translates to `SELECT * FROM product`
- Converts Python code to SQL behind the scenes

---

## 🔹 14. ORM vs SQL
**ORM Pros:**
- Easy syntax, database portability
**ORM Cons:**
- Slower for complex queries

**SQL Pros:**
- Faster, full control
**SQL Cons:**
- Less portable, complex

---

## 🔹 15. Type of Django ORM
- Uses **Active Record Pattern**
- DB rows map to Python objects

---

## 🔹 16. What is Loading in SQL?
- Loading = Inserting external data into tables

---

## 🔹 17. What is Indexing in SQL?
- Speeds up data retrieval by indexing columns

---

## 🔹 18. JWT Token: What, Why, How?
**What**: JSON Web Token for authentication
**Why**: Stateless, secure, compact
**How it works:**
1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature (encoded + signed)

---

## 🔹 19. What is Caching?
- Store data temporarily to avoid recalculation or re-fetching

---

## 🔹 20. `HttpResponse` vs `JsonResponse`
- `HttpResponse`: Send HTML/Plain Text
- `JsonResponse`: Send structured JSON data

---

## 🔹 21. What is Middleware?
- Middle layer between request & response
- Django Middleware Types:
  - `AuthenticationMiddleware`
  - `SessionMiddleware`
  - `CsrfViewMiddleware`

---

## 🔹 22. What is CSRF Token?
**CSRF = Cross Site Request Forgery**
- Protects from unauthorized actions by embedding a token in forms
- Validated server-side

---

## 🔹 23. Why Functions?
- Promote **abstraction**, **reusability**, and **scalability**

---

## 🔹 24. How to Handle DB Schema in Live Projects?
1. Use version control for schema (e.g., Flyway)
2. Always take backups
3. Test on staging before applying to production

---

## 🔹 25. Code First vs DB First
**Code First**:
- Write models → Generate DB via migrations

**DB First**:
- Start with DB schema → Generate code (models)

---

## 🔹 26. What is Microservice?
> *[You can expand this section: A software design pattern...]*

---

## 🔹 27. Time Complexity vs Space Complexity
- Depends on project need
- Optimize for whichever is more critical

---

## 🔹 28. `range()` vs `xrange()`
**range** (Python 3): returns list
**xrange** (Python 2): returns generator (lazy loading)

---

## 🔹 29. `.py` vs `.pyc`
> *[You can expand: `.py` is source, `.pyc` is compiled bytecode]*

---

## 🔹 30. Python: Interpreted or Compiled?
> *Python is interpreted; explain both types of execution environments.*

---

## 🔹 31. `a == b` vs `a is b`
- `==` checks **value equality**
- `is` checks **identity** (same memory address)

---

## 🔹 32. What is Substring?
- A part of a string extracted using slicing

---

## 🔹 33. How to Improve API Response Speed?
> *Add techniques: caching, async, DB indexing, pagination...*

---

## 🔹 34. IST to UTC Conversion
> *Use `pytz` or `datetime` to convert timezone-aware objects*

```python
from datetime import datetime
import pytz
ist = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
utc = pytz.utc
dt = ist.localize(datetime.now())
print("UTC:", dt.astimezone(utc))
```
