**(1) What is Python?**
Ans: Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

**(2) Why Python?**
Ans: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is object-oriented and has dynamic semantics. Python works with Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and other platforms. Python has a straightforward syntax when compared to other languages. Compared to other programming languages, Python allows developers to write programs with fewer lines.

**(3) What kinds of applications can Python be used for?**
Ans: Python can be used for various applications, including games for the web and the internet, scientific and computational applications, language development, image processing, graphic design, enterprise and business applications, operating systems, web applications, email processing, and more.

**(4) What are the advantages of Python?**
Ans: Python has several advantages, including being an interpreted language, extensible, object-oriented, and providing built-in data structures like tuples, lists, and dictionaries.

**(5) Python Functions?**
Ans: A function is a piece of code that is written once and can be executed whenever the program calls for it. An example of a function definition in Python is as follows:

```python
def function_name(parameters_list):
    # --- statements ---
    return a_value
```
