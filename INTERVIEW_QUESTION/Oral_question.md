## Core Python

### 1. What is Python?

> **Ans**:  
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is an **interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics**.

---

### 2. Why Python?

> **Ans**:  
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. It runs on many platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.), and code syntax is simple and readable. Programs in Python are typically shorter and faster to write than in many other languages.

---

### 3. What kinds of applications can Python be used for?

> **Ans**:  
Python is versatile and is used for:
- Web and internet development
- Scientific and computational applications
- Games, language development
- Image processing, graphic design
- Enterprise and business applications, OS development
- Web/email applications, and more

---

### 4. What are the advantages of Python?

> **Ans**:  
- **Interpreted** (no need for compilation)
- **Extensible** with modules written in C/C++
- **Object-oriented**
- **Built-in data structures** (lists, tuples, dicts)
- **Readable and concise syntax**

---

### 5. What is the `pass` statement?

> **Ans**:  
The `pass` statement is a placeholder for future code. It does nothing when executed but avoids errors from empty code blocks.

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
    pass
```

---

### 6. What are the `break` and `continue` statements?

| Statement | Usage | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `break` | Exits the loop immediately |<pre>for i in range(5):<br>    if i == 3:<br>        break<br>    print(i)</pre> |
| `continue` | Skips rest of current iteration |<pre>for i in range(5):<br>    if i == 3:<br>        continue<br>    print(i)</pre> |

---

### 7. What are `is`, `not`, and `in` operators?

- **is**: Tests object identity (not equality)
    ```python
    x = [1,2,3]
    y = [1,2,3]
    print(x is y)    # False, different objects
    ```
- **not**: Logical negation
    ```python
    x = True
    print(not x)    # False
    ```
- **in**: Value containment in a sequence
    ```python
    my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
    print(3 in my_list)   # True
    ```

---

### 8. What is a ternary operator?

> **Ans**:  
A way to use if-else in an expression.

```python
age = 20
result = "You can vote" if age >= 18 else "You cannot vote"
print(result)
```

---

### 9. What are `*args` and `**kwargs`?

    list2 = [4,5]
    list1.extend(list2) # [1,2,3,4,5]
    ```
- **`index()`**: Find index of first occurrence of value  
    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 20]
    print(my_list.index(20))  # 1
    ```

---

### 11. What are `remove` and `pop` functions in a list?

- **`remove()`**: Remove first occurrence of a value  
    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 20]
    my_list.remove(20)   # [10, 30, 20]
    ```
- **`pop()`**: Remove and return by index (default: last)  
    ```python
    my_list = [10, 20, 30]

    print(item)
# (1, 'a') etc.
```

---

### 16. What is shallow and deep copy?

- **Shallow copy**: New outer object, inner objects are references.
    ```python
    import copy
    original = [1, [2,3]]
    shallow = copy.copy(original)
    ```

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### What is OOP?

> **Ans**:  
A programming paradigm based on objects and classes, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

---

### Inheritance vs Polymorphism

- **Inheritance**: Acquire properties/methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Take many forms (methods with same name behave differently).

---

### What is a class?

> **Ans**:  
Blueprint for creating objects (instances).

### What is a function?

> **Ans**:  
Re-usable block of code. Invoked by name.

### What is encapsulation?

> **Ans**:  
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through object's methods.

### What is abstraction?

> **Ans**:  
Providing only essential information; hiding the implementation details.

### Instance vs Class Variables

- **Instance variable**: Specific to object
- **Class variable**: Shared by all instances

### Static vs Class Methods

- **Static method**: Does NOT receive class or instance as argument.
- **Class method**: Receives the class as first argument.

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_meth(): pass
    @classmethod
    def class_meth(cls): pass
```

---

## Development Practices

### What is PYTHONPATH?

- An environment variable specifying additional directories to look for Python modules.

---

## DevOps

### What is your experience with CI/CD?

> **Ans**:  
Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.

---

## Unit Testing & Debugging

- **Unit Testing**: Writing test cases (commonly with `unittest` or `pytest`) to verify individual code units.
- **Debugging**: Using `print()`, IDE debuggers, or `pdb` module.
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling (`cProfile`), optimizing data structures, algorithms, and using built-ins/libraries.
